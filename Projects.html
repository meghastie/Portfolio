          <p>Here, I will talk to you about projects I have undertaken in order of recencey. Demo videos coming soon! In the meantime, feel free to fork any of the below projects and try them out - all source code has been uploaded to <a href = "https://github.com/meghastie">my GitHub.</a> </p>

          <h3 class = "fade-in">My Portfolio!</h3>
          <p class = "fade-in">I decided to make a portfolio to provide a bit more information about myself than on one page of a CV. This website serves as a comprehensive display of my technical abilities, creativity, achievements and overall passion for Software Development. By creating a professional and aesthetically pleasing portfolio, I hope to attract potential clients and employers, demonstrate my growth and expertise, and highlight my commitment to continuous learning and improvement within the field.</p>
          <p class = "fade-in">I started by creating an interactive portfolio on Figma. This was really useful to refer to when developing this site as I could physically see how it would look in the end. After developing a rough prototype, I made tweaks and changes as appropriate. <a href = "https://www.figma.com/proto/kVKi83pAUPtClfpiZBMPNy/Portfolio?node-id=1-2&t=V1KcmVYFvn6veWHm-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2%3A59">Click here to see the prototype I made. </a></p>

          <h3 class = "fade-in">2D Platformer Video Game</h3>
          <p class="fade-in">Games design has always fascinated me, so I took it upon myself to create my own 2D game, developed fully on java.</p>
          <p class="fade-in">I first took on a mini painting project to familiarise myself with java 2D graphics and the Swing library. I used a tutorial on youtube by 'Learn to Code By Gaming' to create a simple Bob Ross inspired painting in java using Swing. Heres how the finished painting looked: </p>
          <img src= "images/painting1.png" style = "width: 600px; margin: 20px" alt = "tutorial painting">
          <p class="fade-in">When finishing the tutorial, I decided to create my own painting to consolidate my knowledge. This is how it looked:</p>
          <img src= "images/painting2.png" style = "width: 600px; margin: 20px" alt = "my own painting">
          <p class="fade-in">After getting used to the Swing library and java 2D graphics, I decided to move on and create my very own game. I used a youtube tutorial by KaarinGaming to develop the game.</p>
          <p class = "fade-in">The player can move left and right by using the A and D keys respectively, and can jump using the space bar. As of now the game has 3 levels, and to progress through each the player must kill all enemies, who will chase the player and try to attack them when in range. The player can attack by using a left click or power attack by pressing the back space key. As well as fighting enemies, the player must avoid projectiles like cannonballs, and traps like spikes. The game can be paused and unpaused using the escape key, and music / sound effects volume can be adjusted when paused or by selecting the options button in the home menu . Red potions will boost a players health and blue potions will boost a players power.</p>
          <p class = "fade-in">In the future, I plan to add harder, longer levels with tougher enemies as well as an instructions tab.</p>
          <p class="fade-in">Overall, this project gave me really good insight into game development and creating an interactive GUI through java. I throughly enjoyed it from start to finish, and i'm excited to utilise my Swing knowledge in subsequent projects. Feel free to check out the source code on my <a href="">github</a>. Note that the demo below does not include the games audio.</p>
        
    

          <h3 class = "fade-in">Scotbank</h3>
          <p class = "fade-in">Scotbank was created in a group of 5 for the practical part of my second year elective ran by JP Morgan. Head to <a href = "AboutMe.html">About Me</a> to find out more about the class.</p>
          <p class = "fade-in">Scotbank is an online banking app developed for a family owned bank who decided to integrate more technology into their business. The application allows ScotBank customers to log in and view details around their balance, spending and transactions.</p>
          <p class = "fade-in">To create ScotBank, we had to develop a frontend and a backend, and then connect all components to create a working application. This was a completely independent project, the only resources we were provided with were two API's - one containing details of every account in the bank and the other containing all transactions. We extracted the data from the API's into our database - parsing it differently depending if it was a JSON or XML file - and used endpoints and handlebars to communicate with the frontend. Form validation ensured only customers who's data were stored in the API were able to log in and see only their specific details, such as available balance, all of their transactions, types of transactions and more - which was obviously different for each customer.</p>
          <p class = "fade-in">The application will only work if a name is entered which exists in the API. The bank manager can also log in to see the list of all acounts, all transactions and the top spenders.</p>
        

          <h3 class = "fade-in">Bulls and Cows</h3>
          <p class = "fade-in"> As part of my advanced programming class in Second year, I was placed into an agile team of 5, where we were tasked with creating the classic 'Bulls and Cows' codebreaking game in java. To read more about the class and agile methodologies I learned, visit my <a href = "AboutMe.html">About Me</a> page.</p>
          <p class = "fade-in">This game starts by using the terminal to allow a user to create an account, log in, continue as a Guest or quit and uses input validation to ensure a valid username is entered. The user can then play the game, view their stats, view a leaderboard (top 10 successfully deciphered codes), get instructions or quit. On choosing to play the game, the user will be tasked with deciphering a secret code, consisting of either 4 different numbers or letters. Each guess the user makes, they will be shown how many 'Bulls' and 'Cows' they managed to achieve. A Cow represents a correct character, but is in the wrong position and a Bull represents a correct character, at the correct location - if the user gets 4 Bulls they win. The user is also able to save/load a secret code so they can try deciphering it again. They can also get a hint to help solve their code. </p>
      

          <h3 class = "fade-in">Simple Linux Shell</h3>
          <p class = "fade-in">In another group of 5, my team and I were tasked to create a Shell in C. I discuss my role and responsibilities in the project in my <a href = "AboutMe.html">About Me</a> section of the website.</p>
          <p class = "fade-in">The shell prompts the user for input, reads and parses user input correctly, executes external commands, sets it's home directory, gets the current path when asked and restores it's home path on exiting, changes directories, adds the past 20 commands to an externl history file and gets a command from the file and executes it, keeps a persistent history of commans, set ups, invokes, removes and prints aliases and keeps persistent aliases</p>
          <p class = "fade-in">All files and stages for the shell are available on my <a href = "https://github.com/meghastie/CS210-Simple-Shell/blob/main/README.md">GitHub.</a> I'm ecstatic to share that the project was graded very highly.</p>

          <h3 class = "fade-in">GroomingTails Website</h3>
          <p class = "fade-in">At the moment, I am working on creating a website for my mother's dog grooming business, GroomingTails.</p>
          <p class = "fade-in">So far, the website has a responsive design that ensures seamless navigation across various devices. The website features an attractive interface and colour scheme throughout. I plan to include a home page, prices information page, a page introducing my mother and a gallery of her past work.</p>
          <p class = "fade-in">Developing this website has gave me invaluable, real world experience in understanding and meeting client requirements. Furthermore, this project honed my ability to activley listen and transform her vision into a real webpage. Through regular conversations and evaluation, I am learning to ask the right questions and make improvements to ensure the final product aligned perfectly with her vision. This project has taught me the importance of clear communication and flexibility in bringing a clients idea to life. I hope to finish this project very soon, so stay tuned!</p>
