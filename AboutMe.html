            <h4 class = "fade-in">June 2021 - Present</h4>
            <p class = "fade-in">Currently, I am a customer experience host at Arnold Clark, where I excel in delivering exceptional customer service and ensuring customer satisfaction. My role demands adept multitasking: I managE a large volume of incoming calls, provide assistance to customers in the showroom and singlehandly run a café whilst maintaining a friendly and professional manner. Due to this, I'm very experienced with performing effectively in a high pressure environment. In addition, I handle administrative and housekeeping tasks, and have knowledge in GDPR compliance and key cyber security practices. As I am the first point of contact for complaints, I have really honed my problem solving abilities - a vital skill for Computer Science. Moreover, this position has enabled me to develop great interpersonal and communication skills which I am able to seamlessly apply in my Academic career. Both customers and colleagues consistently praise my ability to alway maintain an enthusiastic attitude.</p>

            <p class = "fade-in">During June 2024, I was a mentor for the Strathclyde Accelerate Program's Computer Science Challenge. This program aims to provide additional academic support for prospective students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Through the course of the week, I guided students in creating a prototype which was socially inclusive and aimed at improving lives. We utilised industry techniques, like creating paper prototypes and then using figma to digitalise them, and even taught students to program mcirobits. In the end, my group developed 'Handbands' - innovative gloves which aids those with mobility issues play instruments. The program gave me the chance to significantly refine my leadership and conflict resolution skills which I have since been able to apply in other aspects of my life. Overall, the program was really rewarding, and I loved being able to inspire the next generation of Computer Scientists.</p>

            <h4 class = "fade-in">April 2024</h4>
            <p class = "fade-in">Upon finishing my exams, I decided to take part in JP Morgan's Software Engineering Job Simulation. This experience provided valuable insight into the typical day to day of a JP Morgan Software Engineer. The simulation required me to set up a local development environment by forking and cloning via GitHub and installing the required tools, repair broken files within the Git repository to output correct data on the web application and use JP Morgan's open source library - Perspective - to create a live graph which displays stock data in a clear and appealing way. The simulation was thouroughly enjoyable and made me even more passionate about becoming a Software Engineer.</p>

            <h4 class = "fade-in">January 2024 - March 2024</h4>
            <p class = "fade-in">As part of my second year elective, I participated in a class taught by JP Morgan associates focusing on agile techniques in industry. At the same time, I worked in an agile team of 5 to create an online banking application over a period of 10 weeks. For the project I was mostly involved in creating a tailored front end for each specific user, but also helped create the database to store user data and helped work on our controller classes to provide a working frontend. The class was extremely rewarding and helped massively broaden my knowledge on developing applications and agile techniques as well as preparing for my transfer toward industry.

            <h4 class = "fade-in">January 2024 - March 2024</h4>
            <p class = "fade-in">As part of my C module in Second Year, I was placed into a group of 5 members where we developed a simple linux C shell. We programmed a variety of standard and external commands, providing the basic functionality of a shell and more. Using Github, we uploaded and maintained the different stages of the project ensuring correct version control and effective collaboration. Within this group I adopted a leadership position, distributing tasks with ease. My practical responsibilities consisted of implementing aliasing for commands, writing and loading the shells history and aliases to/from external files on opening/terminating the shell, getting and setting the shells path, testing the code as each feature was developed and general housekeeping. We faced technical challenge's along the way like getting the aliasing to work correctly, which we overcame through collective problem-solving and testing. Alongside the practical work, we studied the basics of operating systems. This deepened my understanding of C programming, providing a better quality project.

            <p class = "fade-in">In my Second Year, I collaborated in a group of 5 to create a classic code breaking java game - Bulls and Cows. We used a variety of agile methods to develop this game, like creating functional and non-functional requirements, developing user stories, creating a class diagram, using version control and implementing features from the product backlog in a series of 3 sprints. My main roles in this project consisted of saving the player details to an external file, parsing a file of 15 words and choosing a word, writing the majority of our report and general housekeeping. Developing this project significantly enhanced my java skills and provided a practical.

            <h4 class = "fade-in">August 2021 - May 2022</h4>
            <p class = "fade-in">Over the course of my final year in high school, I undertook a course in Cyber Security. This course provided me with knowledge in data security, digital forensics and even ethical hacking. I was taught about digital legislation, such as: The Data Protection Act (1998), The Computer Misuse Act (1990) and The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act and many real world case studies under these laws. The course also taught me the very basics of networks. One of my assessments involved securing a crime scene and finding and analysing evidence to solve the crime. As a result of this class I am very knowledgable about the best cyber security practices and legislation.</p>

            <p class = "fade-in">As part of completing my Duke of Edinburgh award in 2019, I volunteered at my local charity shop, Barnardo's. During my time at Barnardo's I learned a variety of essential retail skills such as how to operate a cash register, pricing, merchandising and more. Working in retail required I paid strong attention to details - a skill I have refined and carry to this day. I regularly interacted with a diverse range of customers which taught me to improve my patience and empathy.</p>

            <p class = "fade-in">Playing netball for 10 years has significantly contributed to my academic skillset and general mindset. Because I done Netball for so long, I developed concrete teamwork and communication abilities, which are essential for collaborative projects in Computing. I've been able to transfer the quick thinking and resillience required in playing Netball to tactically solving problems in Computing, where overcoming challenges and not giving up is crucial. </p>
